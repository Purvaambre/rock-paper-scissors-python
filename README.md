# Rock Paper Scissors – Python

This is a beginner-friendly command-line implementation of the classic
Rock Paper Scissors game using Python.

Instead of using lists, the game represents choices using numbers:
- 0 → Rock
- 1 → Paper
- 2 → Scissors

The computer randomly generates a number, and the winner is decided
using conditional statements.
